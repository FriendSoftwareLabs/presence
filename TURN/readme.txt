TURN server

INSTALL:
1. specifiy a installpath in install.sh, if you wish. If not, ../../TURN-server will be used
2. run install.sh
3. Remember to point hello-server config in the right direction. shared -> rtc -> iceServers

RUN:
1. execute as superuser, else TLS wont work.
2.a phoenix_TURN.sh in the install directory will start the server and restart it if it falls down.
When you wish to stop the server, the phoneix.sh script must be killed first, else it will keep respawning the server
OR
2.b Run the binary directly: <installdir>/bin/turnserver

-----------------------
Info, read this aswell:

install.sh will install and setup a TURN server with a least-effort-possible
configuration suitable for webRTC usage. Known weakpoints are the keys used for TLS, and lack
of restrictions on who can use the server:

TLS keys are selfsigned, generated by the script with default values and no password.
The login to the server is static ( set in default.conf ).

A more advanced configuration is advised for a production environment

if you wish to modify the install, instructions to follow can be found here:
